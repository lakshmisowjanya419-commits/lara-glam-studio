## GitHub Pages

- **Pages status badge:** (deploys via GitHub Actions) Add this badge to show workflow status:

	![Deploy to Pages](https://github.com/lakshmisowjanya419-commits/lara-glam-studio/actions/workflows/pages.yml/badge.svg)

- **Quick troubleshooting if you still see 404:**
	- Check the Actions tab and confirm the `Deploy to GitHub Pages` workflow ran successfully.
	- In GitHub Settings → Pages, ensure the Source is set to `GitHub Actions` (the workflow uses the official Pages deploy actions).
	- If you use a custom domain, verify the `CNAME` and DNS records are correct and that Pages shows the domain as active.
	- Confirm `dist/` was uploaded by the workflow (check the deploy job logs). If the build output directory differs, update `path` in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

If you want, I can also add a `docs/` fallback or commit the built `dist/` into `docs/` for immediate Pages publishing without Actions.
